 /dev/tty0 is accessible for root only. Therefore dietpi user should not be able to open a xsession.

Anyway you get a different error massage (EE) no screens found(EE) than I would expect. Pls can you past the entire log file

cat /home/dietpi/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log



ok to bypass the permission issue of non-root user, you could do following

apt update && apt install xserver-xorg-legacy
nano /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
adjust to allowed_users=anybody

On my RPi3B+ I'm able to execute startx as dietpi user now .
