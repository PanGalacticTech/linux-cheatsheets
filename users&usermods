The advantage of using getent over just looking at the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files is that getent will query the system using the system's , NSS - Name Service Switch, which defines how "databases" such as these should be handled on a given system.

NSS
The NSS on most Linux systems is controlled through the file /etc/nsswitch.conf. This file defines the "databases" and then how they should be resolved.

Example In the below you can see that the "database" passwd and group should be provied by files, but it could be provided by LDAP, NIS, or any number of other methods.

# /etc/nsswitch.conf

# Example:
#passwd:    db files nisplus nis
#shadow:    db files nisplus nis
#group:     db files nisplus nis

passwd:     files
shadow:     files
group:      files
#initgroups: files
Other databases
Passwords and groups are just 2, there are many databases that are accessible via getent. Take a look at the getent man page for a full list.

You can also get the list from getent's usage page.

$ getent --help
...
Supported databases:
ahosts ahostsv4 ahostsv6 aliases ethers group gshadow hosts initgroups
netgroup networks passwd protocols rpc services shadow
