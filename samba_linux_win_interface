Essentially Samba is a little bit of open source goodness that enables linux and windows computers talk to each other.

Install Samba

Installing Samba is fairly trivial task and involves you only running 3 commands in the terminal window on your Raspberry Pi.

SHELL
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba # Answer Yes to DHCP 
sudo apt-get install samba-common-bin


After we’ve installed samba on our pi, we need to carry out 2 configuration steps.

Create a folder you will use to share and configure samba to share your folder.

Create Public folder to share
Creating a folder to share is really easy, we’ll just create a folder and call it public. 

SHELL
mkdir public


Warning:
We are going to create a permissive share folder on our pi.
If security is a concern, then you may want to read up about the security considerations on Linux.

This how-to primarily about creating a share to enable easy access to your Pi over a network

Configure Samba﻿
We now need to edit the samba configuration file, so we’ll open the file in nano


SHELL
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf



We need to edit this file in a few locations.

Firstly, because we are going to access the Pi from a Windows 8 computer, we’ll need to change

SHELL
# Change the setting 
# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of 
workgroup = WORKGROUP
wins support = yes

Add the following section

SHELL
[PiShare]
 comment=Raspberry Pi Share
 path=/home/pi/public
 browseable=Yes
 writeable=Yes
 only guest=no
 create mask=0777
 directory mask=0777
 public=no
 
 
 
We now need to exit out of nano so Ctrl + X and save it.

We’ll run a check on the config file to ensure we haven’t broken anything

SHELL
testparm

We should see something like this

SHELL
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)
Processing section "[homes]"
Processing section "[printers]"
Processing section "[print$]"
Processing section "[public]"
Loaded services file OK.
Server role: ROLE_STANDALONE

Your Pi should now be sharing files on the network!

Access PI Shared folder on Windows
You should now be able to access your Raspberry Pi shared folder from you windows machine by open files & folders and navigating to \\raspberrypi

windows shared on raspberry pi
Double clicking on the public folder you may be prompted for a username and password . The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry

ppaassword
Once you’ve entered these you are into the shared folder and you can now add, remove and update files as you wish.

Access Pi Shared Folder on Ubuntu
To Access the same folder from a Ubuntu machine  simply open files and folders and click on Connect to Server and enter the same credentials  as above, but use the IP address of the Pi

ubuntu share
A reminder again that this is a very permissive share and I would strongly advise against leaving it this open, if you plan to connect the Pi to the internet or you’re going to store any particularly sensitive information.


// Create a user with a new password for samba

sudo smbpasswd -a pi
to create the pi samba user. On the Windows, I just use RASPBERRYPI\pi as the user, type in the password and it works.
