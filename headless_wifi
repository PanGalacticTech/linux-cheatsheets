// Follow these steps to set up a headless raspberry pi on wifi:


You will need to define a

wpa_supplicant.conf 

file for your particular wireless network.
Put this file in the boot folder, and when the Pi first boots,
it will copy that file into the correct location in the Linux root file system 
and use those settings to start up wireless networking.


wpa_supplicant.conf 
file example:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

network={
 ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
 psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
