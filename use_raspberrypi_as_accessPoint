Update & Upgrade before starting



These are the two programs we’re going to use to make your Raspberry Pi into a wireless access point. To get them, just type these lines into the terminal:

sudo apt-get install hostapd
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq


Both times, you’ll have to hit y to continue.
hostapd is the package that lets us create a wireless hotspot using a Raspberry Pi, 
and dnsmasq is an easy-to-use DHCP and DNS server.

We’re going to edit the programs’ configuration files in a moment, so let’s turn the programs off
before we start tinkering:

sudo systemctl stop hostapd
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq


For our purposes here, I’m assuming that we’re using the standard home network IP addresses, like 192.168.###.###. Given that assumption, let’s assign the IP address 192.168.0.10 to the wlan0
interface by editing the dhcpcd configuration file. 

Start by copying the dhcpcd.conf file for later to easily revert settings to normal

cd /etc/

cp dhcpcd.conf dhcpcd.conf.safe


Start editing with this command:

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
Now that you’re in the file, add the following lines at the end:

interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.75.10/24
denyinterfaces eth0
denyinterfaces wlan0

(The last two lines are needed in order to make our bridge work –- but more on that in
Step 8.)




We’re going to use dnsmasq as our DHCP server. The idea of a DHCP server is to
dynamically distribute network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses, for
interfaces and services.

dnsmasq’s default configuration file contains a lot of unnecessary information, so
it’s easier for us to start from scratch. Let’s rename the default configuration file and
write a new one:

sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

You’ll be editing a new file now, and with the old one renamed, 
this is the config file that dnsmasq will use. 
Type these lines into your new configuration file:

interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=192.168.75.11,192.168.75.30,255.255.255.0,24h


The lines we added mean that we’re going to provide IP addresses between
192.168.0.11 and 192.168.0.30 
for the wlan0 interface.


Another config file! This time, we’re messing with the hostapd config file. Open ‘er up:

sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

This should create a brand new file. Type in this:

interface=wlan0
bridge=br0
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
ssid=NETWORK
wpa_passphrase=PASSWORD


Note that where I have “NETWORK” and “PASSWORD,” you should come up with your own names. This is how you’ll join the Pi’s network from other devices.

sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
