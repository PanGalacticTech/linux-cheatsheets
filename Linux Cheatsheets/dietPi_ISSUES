// Restarting DHCP

After you connected to the router. Please try: ifdown eth0 && sleep 2 && ifup eth0
htop shows dhclient running, right? The above should re-initiate the DHCP client as well.

You can check the currently applied (or not applied) IP via: ip a

And you can manually run dhclient as well: dhclient eth0

journalctl might as well give some hints. When connecting the device to the router and trying the above to re-init the interface you could check the journal (end of log) for possible error messages.
