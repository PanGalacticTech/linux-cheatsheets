Before starting, I recommend updating your system to avoid any issue later

Type the following command on your Raspberry Pi:


{

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo reboot

}


Xorg is the display server on Linux systems
That’s to say that it’s the core component of any desktop environment
So whatever the choice you have made, you need to install it first

Xorg is available in the Raspbian repository, you can install it with:

{
sudo apt install xserver-xorg
#### sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg ###
}

#### sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit ####

This will install about 75 new packages on your system, and after a few seconds you are ready to move to the next step


Desktop Environment Installation
Now you need to install the desktop environment you have chosen
All of them are available in the Raspbian default repository, so you can install it with apt
Obviously, the command will be different depending on your choice

To install the PIXEL (Default) Desktop, you can type:

{
sudo apt install raspberrypi-ui-mods
}


This will download over 400 packages with approximately 200M to download

If you prefer KDE, use this command:

{
sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop
}

KDE will take more time to install, as you need to download over 700 packages for more than 500M to download
And I didn’t test

{
kde-full
}

but it’s something like 1500M to download!


For LXDE the command is:
{
sudo apt install lxde-core lxappearance
}

This one is lighter, with 100M to download for something like 300 new packages

To install XFCE, enter the following command:
{
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-terminal
}
XFCE is the lightest environment in this list, with less than 300 packages (90M to download)

And finally, the MATE desktop installation can be done with:
{
sudo apt install mate-desktop-environment-core
}

For this one, it’s about 320 packages for 170M on a fresh new Raspbian Buster Lite
You’re almost ready, but don’t reboot the Raspberry Pi right now
For some of them, you’ll need another package 



LightDM
As I told you in introduction, LightDM is the display manager
This package is mandatory to automatically start the desktop environment on boot and also manage the login part
It’s the link between everything if you want (Raspbian, Xorg and your desktop environment)

When I made my tests, most of the previous commands will install LightDM automatically
But you may need it at least for MATE and KDE

To install it, just use the following command:

{
sudo apt install lightdm
}

If it does nothing, it’s because it’s already installed on your system

You can now restart your Raspberry Pi to enjoy your new environment 

sudo reboot


Set Up StartX

When we want to startx to KDE we just need to add one line to /etc/sysconfig/desktop: << This file does not exist in raspberrypi OS

DESKTOP="KDE"
If there is already one line that defines “DESKTOP”, just change the value of it.

Then we will start KDE when we run startx from console.

Free additional gift

The “DISPLAYMANAGER” in the /etc/sysconfig/desktop file is used to specify the default display manager. To make KDM the default display, just add this line:

DISPLAYMANAGER="KDE"



^^^^^ This lot did not work

Trying again >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


The steps below install PIXEL, the official Raspbian desktop environment included with the full version of Raspbian.

After installing Raspbian Lite, setup your password, enable ssh, configure Locale and network etc.

Ensure Raspbian is updated to the latest software.

The essential step is to install the Xorg Display Server

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg

The next (recommended) step is to install xinit which enables you to launch the Xorg Display Server from the command line (with startx)

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit

Install PIXEL, which is the official Raspbian desktop environment
included with the full version of Raspbian. 
(This step takes quite a while.)

sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-ui-mods

The raspberrypi-ui-mods installs the PIXEL desktop environment,
Openbox Window Manager and LightDM Login Manager.

This is a bare bones installation. Included is a Terminal, File Manager,
and tools to manage the desktop environment, plus a few Panel icons
(Bluetooth, Network, Audio, CPU, Clock).








ADDING VNC Server

sudo apt update

sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer

sudo raspi-config

Navigate to interfacing options and enable VNC



HINT:

Do not try and install KDE.
