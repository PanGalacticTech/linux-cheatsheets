To launch a command automatically on login, put the command into a file named
.bashrc
in the user directory (for example /home/pi)

For example, the file could contain
chromium-browser --kiosk www.google.com
to launch Chromium in full-screen pointed to www.google.com

IF problem opening from terminal ->
Try putting the following line just before the one invoking your browser.

export DISPLAY=:1

The line you had which created an error is probably the right command. 
I am not sure whether 1 is the right display number,
but I have the above line in my .bashrc on a host box I VNC into, 
so I can start GUI apps from command line when I want to.
Since it is coming back with :2100 in your error message, you might try display number :0
Also, I would be concerned about starting the app from your 
.bashrc and not ending the line with an ampersand so that 
.bashrc can finish any other things you might place there in addition, after calling the browser. Otherwise,
.bashrc will not close until you close chromium.


Alternative Method:

install openbox and have openbox open the bowser for you.
this would give you a fullscreen webbrowser with NOTHING else. no statusbar, no time, no startmenu, nothing but the browser.
Code: Select all

sudo aptitude install openbox obconf obmenu 
and then make a openbox config file with
Code: Select all

mkdir -p ~/.config/openbox && cp /etc/xdg/openbox/* ~/.config/openbox
Then edit the autostart to openthe browser at boot
Code: Select all

nano ~/.config/openbox/autostart
remove all the code and past this in:
Code: Select all

# Autostart script
#will sleep to make sure everything else loads
sleep 5s && midori  --inactivity-reset=120 -e Fullscreen --app=/PATH/TO/HOMEPAGE/FILE.html
that will make it run with fewer options auto resetting after 2 minutes inactivity


Alternative Method 2:

 I have got it working. It seems you can't start chromium from bash as it there is no gui so fails.

I got chromium to start on boot by adding "@chromium --kiosk www.bbc.co.uk" to the "autostart" file in /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/

Alternative Method 3:
I solved using autostart of LXDE-pi and a sh file with epiphany browser.

I had to install xautomation for simulate an user input
Code: Select all

sudo aptitude install xautomation
In the home of pi I've created a sh file
Code: Select all

touch start_browser.sh
I've inserted the following code in the file
Code: Select all

# running the browser on the main desktop
sudo -u pi epiphany-browser -a --profile ~/.config http://www.google.com/ --display=:0 & 
# waits a few seconds, we wait that the browser has started successfully   
sleep 15s;
# xautomation simulates the pressure on the F11 key for activate the browser in full screen mode on the main desktop
xte "key F11" -x:0
I added the executable permission on the sh file with chmod command
Code: Select all

sudo chmod 755 start_browser.sh
I've modified the autostart files of LXDE-pi session
Code: Select all

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
by adding the following command to run my sh file
Code: Select all

@/home/pi/start_browser.sh
Now our browser should be start in full screen mode at each boot

If it does not, check that the Raspberry's configuration had enabled the boot into the desktop environment
Code: Select all

sudo raspi-config
Select: 3 Enable Boot to Desktop/Scratch

Select: Desktop Log in as user 'pi' at the graphical desktop

Enjoy



Notes#
Yes I had the same problem and the instructions on this stack overflow page helped fix it:

I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Jessie with Chromium 45 installed. I found that you need to copy the existing autostart file to your local:

mkdir -p /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/
cp /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

In short you need to use the pi user's autostart file in order to launch chromium, not the system wide one.

By default the Pi the auto-logon X environment is done with credentials of the pi user.
The config setting's of the Xserver environment of this user is in 
/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart,
NOT in /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart 
(this is the environment for the root user).
