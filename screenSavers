By default, the Raspberry Pi Desktop does not have any easy-to-use screensaver software installed, 
although the screensaver is enabled. Firstly, you should install the X Windows screensaver application.

sudo apt install xscreensaver
This may take a few minutes.

Once this has been installed, you can find the screensaver application 
under the Preferences option on the main desktop menu. 
This provides many options for setting up the screensaver, or disabling it completely.
